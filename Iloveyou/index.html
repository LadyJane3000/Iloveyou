                stunning on the outside too. I love every single part of you simply because it's you, and I'll always,
                always choose you.</p>

        <p>
            This little website is my way of telling you how deeply appreciated, adored, and loved you truly are.
            Every photo of you reminds me just how lucky I am to have you in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be honest, I don‚Äôt even know how to fully express or construct these words, but I‚Äôll try my best, because
            I really want you to know all of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Baby ko, I'm so thankful that I met you, kahit online lang kita nakilala. I'm happy that you noticed me,
            hehe.
            I honestly didn‚Äôt expect that we‚Äôd end up having such long, meaningful conversations. Kwentuhan, tawanan,
            supporting each other in everything,
            and even those nonsense talks that eventually became a part of my everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hanggang sa umabot sa point na ‚Äúparang iba na 'to ah,‚Äù kasi napapa-ibig na ako.
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy crush lang sana kita noon, kasi nga go lang ako kung saan ka masaya. Masaya na ako as long as
            nakakausap kita.
            Goods na ako don. At least we kept in contact. Pero habang tumatagal ang usapan natin, mas lalo kitang
            nagustuhan.
            I‚Äôve gained so much from you. I‚Äôm constantly inspired by everything you do, by your amazing talents.
            And with every moment, mas nakikilala pa kita and I love what I keep discovering.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know we‚Äôve never stood side by side‚Ä¶ never held hands‚Ä¶ never shared a quiet moment in the same room.
            But somehow, you‚Äôve become my favorite feeling in this world. And even though it's all through a screen,
            you‚Äôve made everything feel so real.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love the way you play your guitar. Even from miles away, it feels like you're strumming the strings of my
            heart.
            Each note you play is like a secret message meant just for me. Like your hands were meant to serenade my
            soul from the other side of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            And when you dance‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pure poetry. Even if it‚Äôs just a video call or a short clip, I can‚Äôt take my eyes
            off you.
            You move so effortlessly, so beautifully... it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre dancing just for me. And honestly? I‚Äôd watch
            you sway forever.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love you, and I love the way you play your Rubik‚Äôs Cube. The way your fingers move so quickly and
            confidently,
            solving something so complex like it‚Äôs second nature‚Äîit amazes me every time.
            I see how your mind works... sharp, focused, and brilliant. Every twist and turn is like watching art in
            motion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even when you‚Äôre just casually solving it while we talk, you don‚Äôt even realize how mesmerizing you look.
            It‚Äôs not just impressive, it‚Äôs oddly comforting. Like your own little language of calm and control.
            And I love witnessing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But your voice... your voice is everything. Especially when you sing.
            It‚Äôs like time slows down just to let me listen.
            Even through a screen, your voice reaches straight into my heart.
            You don‚Äôt just sing songs, you sing me into a daydream I never want to wake up from.
        </p>

        <p>
            And the way you draw‚Ä¶ the grace in every movement of your hand, the way your sketches come to life.. it‚Äôs
            hypnotizing.
            Every line you draw feels like a window into your soul, and I fall even deeper with every stroke.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love everything about you. Everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            And the wildest part? I‚Äôve fallen this deeply without ever even holding you.
            But I‚Äôve seen your heart, I‚Äôve heard your laughter, and I‚Äôve felt your presence and that‚Äôs more real than
            anything I‚Äôve ever known.
        </p>

        <p>
            You‚Äôve taken my heart, right through the screen... and I‚Äôm yours, completely.
        </p>

        <p>
            So until the day I get to kiss you for real, I‚Äôll keep loving you like this 
            fiercely, faithfully, and across every mile that tries to keep us apart.
        </p>
